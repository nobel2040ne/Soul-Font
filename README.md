# Soul-Font

[**Soul Font**](https://github.com/nobel2040ne/Soul-Font) is a web-based project by Django designed to preserve and share the emotional warmth and individuality of handwritten text—a cultural element gradually fading in the digital age.

Traditionally, creating a complete Korean font requires manually writing and editing over 10,000 characters. This project dramatically simplifies the process using [**GANs**](https://github.com/clovaai/dmfont) and supporting packages like svg2ttf.

With Soul Font, users can generate their own fully functional TTF fonts by writing just 28 template characters. The system handles the rest—automatically generating the remaining characters, compiling the output into a downloadable font file, and completing the entire generation process in approximately 10 minutes on M1 Pro.
