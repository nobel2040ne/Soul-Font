# Soul-Font

# Overview

Soul Font is a web-based project designed to preserve and share the emotional warmth and individuality of handwritten text—a cultural element gradually fading in the digital age. Traditionally, creating a complete Korean font requires manually writing and editing over 10,000 characters. This project dramatically simplifies the process using generative AI (GANs) and supporting packages like svg2ttf.

With Soul Font, users can generate their own fully functional TTF fonts by writing just 28 template characters. The system handles the rest—automatically generating the remaining characters and compiling the output into a downloadable font file.

# Technology Stack

Frontend Theme: “Cherry Blossom”

UI Design: Glassmorphism for a warm, soft, and elegant visual experience

Backend Framework: Django (Python)

Font Pipeline: GAN-based generation + SVG to TTF conversion

# Goal

This project aims to democratize the creation of personal Korean fonts, enabling anyone to transform their handwriting into a usable, shareable, and artistic font. It bridges the gap between machine learning and human expression through thoughtful UX and aesthetic design.
